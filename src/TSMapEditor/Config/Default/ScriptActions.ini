; C&C World-Altering Editor (WAE)
; https://github.com/CnCNet/WorldAlteringEditor

; This file defines the script actions available in the map editor.
; The sections are parsed in their order and the script actions are
; assigned internal indexes based on their order in this file.

; Each script action has a name, a description, a parameter description
; and can optionally have a set of preset values.
; A script action can optionally also specify a type for its parameter
; so the editor can alter its UI (for example, if the script expects a waypoint value).
